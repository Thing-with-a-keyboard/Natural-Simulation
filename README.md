# Natural Simulation
 A Python based program designed to simulate Evolution via natural selection

Genes and what they are:

GENOME:
    Metabolic rate: how many generations it takes to digest a meal. increases in this gene are associated with an increase in minimum temperature resistance.
    Metabolic Size: How many units of food is consumed when organism has a meal
    Age Limit: The natural lifespan of a creature. It is possible for an organism to live past this limit, but each generation it lives past the lifespan it is more likely to die of 
    old age.
    litter Size: The amount of offspring produced by a pair of organisms
    Gestation period: how many generations it takes before an organism is able to give birth again
    fertility: the chance that a pair of organisms will successfuly produce offspring
    Maximum Temperature resistance: The highest temperature an organism can survive in. organisms can survive in temperatures higher than this, but the greater the disparity between
    the maximum temperature resistance gene and the actual temperature, the more likely the organism is to die from overheating. Primary Increases in this gene are associated with a reduction in the minimum temperature resistance.
    Minimum Temperature resistance: the lowest temperature an organism can survive in. organisms can survive in temperatures lower than this, but the greater the disparity between
    the maximum temperature resistance gene and the actual temperature, the more likely the organism is to die from freezing. Primary increases in this gene are associated with a reduction in the maximum temperature resistence. Increases in this gene are associated with an increase in time it takes to digest food (metabolic rate)
